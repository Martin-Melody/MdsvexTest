## Welcome to SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a modern framework built on top of Svelte, enabling developers to create highly performant web applications with ease. Unlike traditional frameworks, it takes advantage of file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and progressive enhancement—all with minimal boilerplate.

In this guide, we'll explore not only the fundamentals but also some intermediate techniques to build scalable SvelteKit applications.

### What Makes SvelteKit Different?

- **File-based Routing**
- **Zero Configuration Deployments**
- **Built-in Load Functions**
- **Flexible Adapters**

### Creating Your First Page

To create a page, simply add a file inside `src/routes`:

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/about/+page.svelte -->
<script>
	let name = 'SvelteKit';
</script>

<h1>Hello from {name}!</h1><p>This page was rendered using file-based routing.</p>
```

### Using Layouts Effectively

Layouts let you share structure across multiple pages using `+layout.svelte`:

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<header>
	<nav>
		<a href="/">Home</a>
		<a href="/about">About</a>
	</nav>
</header>

<slot />
```

### Data Loading with +page.ts

SvelteKit's `load` function allows you to fetch data before rendering:

```ts
// src/routes/blog/+page.ts
export async function load() {
	const posts = await fetch('/api/posts').then((res) => res.json());
	return { posts };
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement

Even if JavaScript fails, your SvelteKit app still works thanks to SSR. You can then hydrate it on the client for interactivity.

## Final Thoughts

SvelteKit isn't just fast—it's developer-friendly. In future posts, we’ll explore **API routes**, **form actions**, and **endpoint security**.
