## Why TypeScript Matters

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by providing static typing, enabling better tooling, safer refactors, and more reliable codebases. As your projects grow, using TypeScript becomes less of an option and more of a necessity.

### Strict Typing Saves Time

One key advantage of TypeScript is early error detection:

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
	console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}!`);
}
```

### Utility Types You Should Know

```ts
type User = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email?: string;
};

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
type UserPreview = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;
```

### Type Narrowing

```ts
function handle(value: unknown) {
	if (typeof value === 'string') {
		console.log(value.toUpperCase());
	}
}
```

### Avoiding Any

Using `unknown` pushes you to validate inputs instead of trusting unsafe data.

### Interfaces vs Types

Interfaces are ideal for extending and structuring APIs, while types excel at creating complex unions.

## Final Reminder

TypeScript is a journey. Start simple, stay strict, and let your editor be your co-pilot.
